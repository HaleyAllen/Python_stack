I chose to make as many errors as i could while creating a table and heres all the mistakes I made.
1: create table line is in lowercase lettering instead of caps.
2: the name of the table to create is not in ``
3: id is not in `` and  there is no id number given.
4: number of errors is not in `` and does not have _ instead of spaces.
5: number of erors is not given a data type.
6: created at is not in `` and its data type should be DATETIME instead of int
7: adress 1 & 2 are not in `` and there should not be more then one of the same variable.
8: no primary key given
9: the crate table doesnt have the ENGINE=InnoDB at the end

create table if not exists errors(
id int
number of errors
created_at int
adress1 char()
adress2 char()
)
